   - Enable the PageSpeed Insights API
   - Set the environment variable:
     ```
     # On Windows
     set PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     
     # On macOS/Linux
     export PAGESPEED_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. Set up your OpenRouter API key (for Gemini AI analysis):

   - Get your API key from the dashboard
   - Set the environment variable:
     ```
     # On Windows
     set OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     
     # On macOS/Linux

     ```

## üíª Usage

1. Start the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run psi_accessibility_app.py
   ```

2. Prepare a CSV file with a column named 'urls' containing the web pages you want to analyze

3. Upload your CSV file in the app interface

4. Select your preferred analysis strategy (mobile or desktop)

5. View the results and detailed reports for each URL

6. For URLs with failed audits, click "Analyze with Gemini" to get AI-powered recommendations on how to fix the issues

## üìä Understanding the Results

The app categorizes accessibility audits into four groups:

- **Failed Audits ‚ùå**: Automatically detected issues that must be fixed to improve accessibility
- **Requires Manual Verification ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Aspects that need human judgment and testing with assistive technologies
- **Passed Audits ‚úÖ**: Requirements successfully met according to automated testing
- **Not Applicable ‚è©**: Audits that don't apply to the current page
- **AI Recommendations ü§ñ**: Specific suggestions from Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model on how to fix failed audits

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

- **API Limits**: Google enforces rate limits on the PageSpeed Insights API
- **Automated ‚â† Fully Compliant**: Automated testing covers only about 30% of potential accessibility issues
- **Manual Testing Required**: Complete accessibility assessment requires human testing with assistive technologies
- **WCAG Basis**: Lighthouse audits are designed to test for failures of WCAG success criteria
